    - N POSIX semaphores

    - 2 POSIX shared memory segments

    - An improvised priority-stack

    - rlr instances can run in parallel

The parent creates the resounces and counts the lines of the file. He won't
start the loop until all the children have read the total number of lines.

The child leaves its message at a specific part of the segment, and notifies.

SNIPPET:child-shmem-offset

The parent cycles through the "rows" of the children's segments, reading one
message per notification.

SNIPPET:parent-loop

The request is written back-to-front.

SNIPPET:back-to-front-writing

Before writing it, it is guaranteed that there was a null character at
position 0. That character should be overriden last, because while the parent
does wait for a semaphore, he doesn't know the source of the semaphore post,
and he will pick up the first child request he finds to be non-empty.

A request might also be an 'I read it' message.

SNIPPET:req-send-done

When a request is about another file segment, it
is stacked, but with priority. It's called
'bubbling' in the code.

SNIPPET:bubble-stack

Then, multiple requests are popped and everyone
interested is notified once the segment changes.

SNIPPET:pop-requests

From the child's perspective:

SNIPPET:dev-mode

SNIPPET:make-dev

'const' isn't used for primitive types because data eventually reaches a
standard function such as readline, which doesn't declare any arguments
constant. So it feels awkward.

Plus I follow a retro style. The long names aren't retro but the declarations
are at the top.

Similarly I avoid unsigned types because they might come from the return value
of a function. Type conversions remove any guarantee unsigned types are
supposed to help with.

There are tiny functions because I'm trying out the "Uncle Bob" principles of
clean coding. The main point is to skip reading code easily. I do rely on
jump-to-definition functionality, though it does break with preprocessor
definitions.

I tried out some test driven development. It didn't go the best but it was
entertaining.

Some .c files are different with  make test

SNIPPET:testable-fork

SNIPPET:fork-in-test

The specific example is from a test that was actually written after making the
forks work. There were bugs and any part of the code was suspicious, so I
thought to secure the forks.

The tests aren't very sophisticated, they 'announce' the situation. Also they
never deallocate.
